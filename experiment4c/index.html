				<h2>Description</h2>
				<br>
				<div>
					<b>Infinity</b>
					<p>I used infinity in my world to represent a never ending and ever-shifting landscape, tessellations, and patterns. It is more like a gif where you control which part of the world you look at, how fast it moves, and you can actively shape and manipulate it based on your inputs.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<b>Variation in Space
					</b>
					<p>As you can see space is constantly shifting and varies based on the sliders you can make many different terrains some concrete landscapes and random tessellations</p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<b>Variation in Key</b>
					<p>Different keys will show different color tiles, different color backgrounds, and originally different shaped tiles which would shift on their own (and still do), but now the user controls the range from which the tiles width and height are randomly chosen.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<b>Signs of life</b>
					<p>There is a sparkle mode that randomizes the color values based on perlin noise, also the tiles sizes are constantly shifting using random noise to create a lot of life and movement within the scene.
					</p>
				</div>
			</div>

				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>Using the user's world key I was able to create a world seed from the string which would generate the same perlin noise and random values to preserve values for each key and seed. For rainbow road I was just getting started with generating this infinite landscape. I started by making a roadWidth which would draw a colored tile infinitely. From there I wrote a function to color in each tile using colors from the rainbow. Using perlin noise I was able to achieve different effects such as vertical road lines, horizontal road lines, and random shapes along the road. I also added a sparkle function which will further randomize the color of each tile between a set value which is able to distinguish that color.
				I also was able to add an offset to the road center such that it appears to be curivng and turning at random points. For the massive landscapes I was able to zoom out by making the tile sizes smaller. I also added some random displacement on the tiles so they appear to be moving or shifting constantly in and out of place. I had the most fun making the interesting tiles (Experiment 4c) and I played around with using random values to shift the tile size which can be controlled by the user. This allows for massive landscapes with height and depth while also creating abstract tile art and patterns.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>I learned quite a bit from this assignment and grew in creativity along the way. I started with a concrete image and moved more to abstraction, using noise to help me and the user create abstract art. I definitely was very lost with what to do in the beginning, but I think starting with a concrete image definitely helps. I had a hard time with learning when to use perlin noise or random() function calls when coloring tiles. I am very happy with the result and I believe it does look like an infinite rainbow road, landscapes, atoms, and patterns.</p>

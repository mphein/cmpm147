				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>This project was made to gain experience with text generators. I thought it would be cool to experiment with how aliens might flirt and compliment each other. The intended audience experience is supposed to be humorous and lighthearted. I experimented by conjoining prefixes and suffixes to create names and planets. I also used chatGPT to help me brainstorm some of these prefixes and suffixes based on words we associated with aliens or outer space!</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>From the project's base code, I created new lists of fillers for the replacer function to choose from. I also created the base story involving a first date between two aliens. The main function is called in project.js
					which then cretes a dictionary with key:value pairs. The values associated with each key is a list of words that can be substituted into a specific part of the story. The replacer function filters through the story and replaces words matching the slotPattern.
					It then replaces that slot with a word associated with a key randomly chosen from the value list.
				</p>
			</div>

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>Overall seeing this makes me less scared of text generators and how to incorporate them. I felt that the generator I made had a decent amount of variety, and felt successful. Some difficulties were styling this experiment on the web page and coming up with unique words that and combinations that would make the story feel unique and fun.</p>
